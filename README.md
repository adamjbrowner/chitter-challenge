# Chitter Challenge

## How far I got

Unfortunately, due to some horrible BCrypt error that took the entirety of
Sunday to solve, I only got up to allowing users to post peeps. However, what I
have done seems to work well.

## How I did it

I rigidly followed the TDD path in order to effectively drive the development
of my app.

## Installation
```
1. git clone https://github.com/adamjbrowner/chitter-challenge.git
2. bundle


```
